# Group Campout

I went on this honors campout because I love camping. I also generally love meeting new people and there's very few ways to better meet people. On this campout I went with a open mind towards sound due to class. It was an entirely new experience. My girlfriend and I went on a morning walk around the lake we were camping by and for the first twenty minutes it was just a chorus of different birds with the occasional plooping from a fish jumping to catch a bug. Then at some point we were on the far side of the lake and we heard what sounded like someones footsteps right next to us until we looked around and saw that the sound had carried from the far side of the extremely still lake.

All in all I would definetly recommend going on campouts it's so good to be able to get back in touch with our biology. Aside from that I would recommend slowing down and just taking some time to listen, you never know what you might notice.
