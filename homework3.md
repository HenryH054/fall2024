# Homework 3

## Problem 1

### Subpart A

Since only one needs to satisfy the condition everyother can be fully connected or extremely sparse. As such this is both sparse and dense.

### Subpart B

This is likely a sparse graph unless there are very few nodes

### Subpart C

Since only one vertex needs to match the requirements this can be either sparse or dense.

### Subpart D

Dense

## Problem 2

All of the above

## Problem 3

$\Theta (m+n)$

## Problem 4

Whenever it contains a directed path that visits every vertex exactly once.
